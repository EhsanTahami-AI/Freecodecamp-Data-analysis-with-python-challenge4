# Freecodecamp-Data analysis with python-challenge4

#For this project visualized time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots.
#I used Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on
#the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations helped me understand 
#the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.
